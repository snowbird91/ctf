**PatriotCTF 2025**

I participated with my club team tjcsc in PatriotCTF 2025, and we got 54th overall!

**Challenge:** Where’s Legally Distinct Waldo Two

**Category:** OSINT

**Flag:** pctf{thompson_hall}

So, here is the provided image:

<del>Wait! I drove by here while heading to the in-person launch event!</del> We can see that there’s some road in between some buildings. This is probably on campus like the first one. Let’s do some reconnaissance.

First, I noticed a building with an interesting and pretty unique glass design. Looking around on Google Maps, I see:

That looks just like the building in the image! Now, let’s match the surroundings and get the angle at which the image was taken from:

This looks pretty similar to the angle at which the image was taken. I see a few similar features:

Looks great! Now, let’s find the building the image was taken from based on this angle:

Thompson Hall? Let’s try that…

Great! The flag was pctf{thompson_hall}. Another easy challenge done!
