**PatriotCTF 2025**

I participated with my club team tjcsc in PatriotCTF 2025, and we got 54th overall!

**Challenge:** Where’s Legally Distinct Waldo Three

**Category:** OSINT

**Flag:** pctf{center_for_the_arts_concert_hall}

So, here is the provided image:

Interesting. I assumed it was on campus because the past two have been so far, and this seems similar. I immediately notice a pond/lake, a sidewalk with a bridge, an arena on the left, and a big parking lot past the trees in the middle. This should be a piece of cake! Let’s look around on Google Maps.

Well this is simply too easy 😭. I see the pond, the arena, parking lot, and a pathway. Let’s note the distinct features from a similar POV:

Now, we can find the building from this angle.

Center for the Arts eh? Let’s try that… Oops! Somehow pctf{center_for_the_arts} didn’t work… Interesting. Let’s gather some more information in street view.

Concert Hall? Let’s try that.

Easy dub! pctf{center_for_the_arts_concert_hall} worked! Unfortunate that I wasted an attempt…
